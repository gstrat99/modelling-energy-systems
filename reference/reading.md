*Introduction to Operations Research* {cite:p}`hillier_introduction_2021` provides a broad overview of mathematical modelling and optimisation methods and is one of the go-to resources if you need more detail on any of the topics discussed in the course, but it is not specific to energy.

*Optimization Models in Electricity Markets* {cite:p}`papavasiliou_optimization_2024` focuses specifically and in detail on electricity markets in the European context, including topics we do not touch on in detail here such as ancillary services, optimal power flow, and demand response.
