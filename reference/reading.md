These books are good resources to go further into optimisation and energy system modelling, and may be available via university libraries:

*Introduction to Operations Research* {cite:p}`hillier_introduction_2021` provides a broad overview of mathematical modelling and optimisation methods. For many years, it has been one of the go-to resources if you need more detail on any of the topics discussed in the course -- but it is not specific to energy.

*Optimization Models in Electricity Markets* {cite:p}`papavasiliou_optimization_2024` is a more recent book focusing specifically and in detail on electricity markets in the European context, including topics we do not touch on in detail here such as ancillary services, optimal power flow, and demand response.

*Hands-On Mathematical Optimization with Python* {cite:p}`postek.etal_handson_2025` is a new book which explains the mathematical theory behind optimisation in a practical and application-focused manner. The book comes with a free [online repository of examples](https://mobook.github.io/MO-book/) in Python/Pyomo using Jupyter notebooks.
